# 00 - MASTER PROJECT BRIEF
## Premium Wellness & Longevity Research Platform

> **Purpose**: This is the complete project specification. Reference this document when you need full context on the platform vision, target audience, business model, or strategic requirements. Other task-specific prompts will reference sections of this document.

---

## Project Overview

You are building an independent, data-rich, privacy-first research platform for affluent individuals researching the world's finest wellness destinations - from luxury spa retreats to medical longevity clinics.

**What this is**: A trusted research authority for people making $3,000-$150,000 wellness decisions. This is not a directory - it's an intelligence platform that provides information, analysis, and access that doesn't exist anywhere else. The platform combines:

- Proprietary scoring methodology that establishes editorial authority
- Dark data that properties don't publish but clients desperately need
- Treatment-first discovery for sophisticated health seekers
- Privacy-first architecture for an audience that demands discretion
- Human expertise visibly backing every recommendation
- Outcome tracking that measures what actually matters: results

**What this is NOT**:
- A directory of every spa or wellness center
- A platform that sells user data
- A site with anonymous, unverified content
- A medical advice service
- A booking engine (we inform decisions, properties handle transactions)

This platform covers only the world's most exceptional wellness destinations - approximately 200-250 properties globally, representing roughly 2-4 elite facilities per country. If a property doesn't warrant international travel specifically for its wellness offerings, it doesn't belong here.

---

## Target Audience

High-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, executives, family offices, and affluent health-seekers who:

- Make significant investments in health optimization ($10K-$150K+ annually)
- Research intensively and privately before major decisions
- Value discretion as much as quality
- Expect human expertise behind digital platforms
- Want to know "does it actually work?" not just "is it nice?"
- Travel internationally for exceptional experiences
- View wellness as strategic investment, not indulgence

---

## Market Context

- Global spa services market: $114B (2025), growing 12.7% CAGR
- Luxury wellness segment: $49.7B (2025)
- Medical spa market: $21B (2025), growing 15% CAGR
- Wellness tourism spending: $1 trillion
- 100% of Asia-Pacific UHNWIs actively pursuing longevity strategies
- 68% of Asia-Pacific HNWIs have formal long-term care plans (2x global average)
- Traditional spa holidays are "out" for ultra-wealthy - they want measurable results

---

## Business Model

- Lead generation fees from properties ($200-2,000 per qualified inquiry)
- Direct affiliate partnerships (negotiated 5-15% commissions)
- Advisory service fees (Phase 2: paid consultations)
- Enhanced property listings
- Future: Premium membership for advanced tools

**Revenue target**: $150K-$350K/month at maturity (18-36 months).

## Core Platform Principles

### 1. Privacy as Foundation

This audience researches sensitive topics: addiction recovery, weight issues, mental health, aging anxiety, performance optimization they don't want employers knowing about. Privacy isn't a feature - it's the foundation.

**Requirements**:
- **Research Mode**: Browse entire site without any tracking, cookies, or data capture. No account required. No "sign up to see more" gates.
- **Zero third-party data sharing**: Explicit, prominent policy. User data never sold, shared with insurers, data brokers, or any third party except the specific property they inquire about.
- **Encrypted lead handling**: All inquiry data encrypted in transit and at rest. Option for inquiries via secure channels (encrypted email, Signal contact for highest-sensitivity).
- **No retargeting**: We will never serve ads to users based on their browsing. No Facebook pixels, no Google remarketing.
- **Data minimization**: Collect only what's necessary. Don't ask for information we don't need.
- **Right to deletion**: One-click complete data deletion, including from backups within 30 days.
- **Transparency**: Clear explanation of what data we collect, why, and exactly what happens to it.
- **GDPR++ approach**: Exceed legal minimums globally, not just in EU.

### 2. Human Authority Behind Every Recommendation

For $150K decisions, users need to know: who is telling me this, and why should I trust them?

**Requirements**:
- **Named Advisory Team**: Real people with photos, credentials, backgrounds, properties personally visited. Visible from MVP, not hidden until Phase 4.
- **Editorial bylines**: All content attributed to named authors with expertise credentials.
- **"Verified Researcher" reviews**: Team members' reviews clearly distinguished, with disclosure of visit circumstances.
- **Trust signals**: "Our team has collectively visited 200+ properties and evaluated 500+ programs."
- **Contact accessibility**: Users can request to speak with a specific advisor, not just submit a form into the void.
- **Expertise transparency**: Each team member's specialization clear.

### 3. Proprietary Authority: The [Brand] Index

To be an authority, not a directory, we need a signature framework for evaluation.

**The Index**: A proprietary scoring methodology that evaluates properties across multiple dimensions with transparent weighting.

**Scoring Dimensions for Tier 1 (Medical/Longevity)**:
| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Clinical Rigor | 30% | Medical credentials, diagnostic depth, evidence-based protocols, physician ratios |
| Outcome Evidence | 25% | Published results, guest-reported outcomes, follow-up protocols |
| Program Depth | 20% | Comprehensiveness, customization, duration options |
| Experience Quality | 15% | Facilities, service, accommodation, dining |
| Value Alignment | 10% | Price relative to what's delivered |

**Scoring Dimensions for Tier 2 (Integrated Wellness)**:
| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Program Effectiveness | 25% | Guest-reported outcomes, expert assessment |
| Holistic Integration | 25% | How well clinical and wellness elements combine |
| Practitioner Quality | 20% | Credentials, experience, guest feedback on individuals |
| Experience Quality | 20% | Facilities, service, accommodation, dining |
| Value Alignment | 10% | Price relative to what's delivered |

**Scoring Dimensions for Tier 3 (Luxury Destination)**:
| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Experience Quality | 35% | Facilities, service, ambiance, accommodation |
| Wellness Offering Depth | 25% | Range and quality of treatments, practitioner skill |
| Transformative Potential | 20% | Can this stay create lasting change? |
| Setting & Environment | 10% | Location, natural surroundings, sense of escape |
| Value Alignment | 10% | Price relative to what's delivered |

**Additional Recognition**:
- **Editor's Choice**: Properties that excel in specific areas
- **Verified Excellence**: Properties where our team has completed full programs
- **Rising Star**: Newer properties showing exceptional promise

### 4. Treatment-First Discovery

Sophisticated seekers often start with a modality, not a destination: "Where can I get EBOO therapy?" or "Who has the Prenuvo full-body MRI?"

**Requirements**:
- Treatment/Modality Database as first-class entity
- Each treatment has profile page with evidence level, properties offering it, price ranges
- Equipment/Technology library with specific machines and brands
- Filter properties by specific treatments, diagnostics, equipment
- "Where can I get X?" as a primary discovery path

### 5. Dark Data: The Competitive Moat

The moat isn't aggregating public information - it's providing intelligence that doesn't exist elsewhere.

**Proprietary Data Points (Properties Don't Publish)**:
| Data Point | Why It Matters | How We Get It |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Actual physician-to-patient ratio | Quality of attention | Direct inquiry, verified guest reports |
| Average booking lead time | Planning reality | Partnership data, user reports |
| Real availability windows | When can you actually go? | Direct inquiry, tracking |
| Staff tenure/turnover | Stability indicator | Research, insider knowledge |
| Return guest percentage | Satisfaction signal | Partnership data |
| Actual vs. advertised customization | Do they really personalize? | Verified guest reports |
| Which physicians are on-site vs. affiliated | Who will you actually see? | Direct verification |
| Post-visit follow-up reality | Do they actually support after? | Verified guest reports |
| Insurance acceptance specifics | What's really covered where | Direct research |
| Cancellation flexibility reality | What happens if plans change? | Terms analysis, guest reports |
| Celebrity/discretion protocols | Privacy level | Research, reputation |
| Dietary accommodation depth | Beyond "vegetarian available" | Direct inquiry |

### 6. Cultural Nuance & Global Considerations

**Cultural Fit Data Points (Per Property)**:
| Data Point | Options/Format |
|------------|----------------|
| Gender-separated facilities | Yes (full) / Yes (partial) / No / On request |
| Religious dietary accommodations | Halal certified / Halal available / Kosher / Vegetarian-Vegan focused / Flexible |
| Privacy architecture | Private villas / Private floors / Semi-private / Shared common areas |
| Discretion level | Ultra-high (NDA standard, no social media) / High / Standard |
| Prayer/meditation facilities | Multi-faith / Specific / Quiet spaces / None |
| Languages (medical staff) | List of languages for clinical consultations |
| Solo traveler friendliness | Optimized for solo / Good / Couples-focused |
| LGBTQ+ welcoming | Explicitly welcoming / Welcoming / Culturally conservative |

### 7. Outcome-Focused Reviews: "Did It Work?"

Standard hospitality reviews ask "Was it nice?" This audience asks "Did it work?"

**Outcome Dimensions (Tier 1 & 2)**:
- Goal achievement: "Did you achieve your stated health goals?"
- Measurable improvements: Optional self-report fields for biological age change, biomarker changes, weight change, etc.
- Protocol quality: "How comprehensive was your personalized protocol?"
- Follow-up quality: "How useful was the take-home/follow-up guidance?"
- Results sustainability: "At 30/90/180 days, how well have results held?"
- Physician endorsement: "Would your personal physician endorse this program?"
