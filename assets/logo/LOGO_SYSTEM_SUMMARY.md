## Design Rationale

### Symbol Choice: CV Monogram with Clarity Motif

The symbol combines the C and V letterforms into an interlocking monogram that represents:

1. **Clarity** — The open arc of the C suggests transparency and openness
2. **Precision** — The geometric V represents exactness and sharp focus
3. **Unity** — The overlapping forms suggest the integration of wellness dimensions
4. **Quiet Authority** — Clean, minimal lines without ornamentation

This approach was chosen over abstract prism/lens concepts because:
- It maintains brand recognition at small sizes
- The letterforms are instantly recognizable as "CV"
- It embodies the "quiet authority" design philosophy
- It works effectively as a favicon and app icon

### Typography

- **Typeface**: Cormorant Garamond Light (with Times New Roman fallback)
- **CLARUS**: 36px, letter-spacing 0.25em (tracking +100)
- **VITAE**: 28.8px (80% of CLARUS), letter-spacing 0.25em
- **Style**: All capitals for premium brand presence
